It evaluates whether what was entered as a requirement for a given customer and what was generated as orders by the MRP (Material Requirements Planning) is consistent. If not, it triggers an HTML email with a list of the discrepancies, providing more time to address the need for manufacturing or to manage stock shortages. Additionally, it searches for parts with available stock but different attributes (e.g., color, etc.), as long as there is positive stock greater than the demand. It also looks for parts with similar dimensions (Euclidean distance) to assess whether it is possible to substitute and avoid manufacturing the parts generated by the MRP.

The email lists the discrepancies in three separate grids and attaches PDFs of each item that needs to be evaluated, along with a grouped report highlighting the colors of the items to be shipped to the customer.
